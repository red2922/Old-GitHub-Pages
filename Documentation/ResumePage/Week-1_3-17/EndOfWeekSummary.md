# End of week summary

> Overall Design is okay. Landing page will be redesigned while projects will be exclusive to the project tab.

> Landing Page should also redesigned to give a nice glance of the different things I have learned. Include design, Programming Languages, Relevant classes, Interesting Hackathon Projects, interesting Experiences, and fun little things about me.

## Backlog

> Landing Page should be redesigned. Nav Bar is good over all. Add indications of what page you are on.
